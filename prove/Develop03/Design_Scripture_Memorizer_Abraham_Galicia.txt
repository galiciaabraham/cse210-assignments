What does the program do?
Help people memorize a scripture by erasing words from the complete quotation.For that:
	-It stores a scripture (both reference and text => This could be a key and value pair)
	-It displays the scripture.
	-If the user presses the "Enter" key it will hide a word from the text by clearing the console and reprinting the text with the missing words.
	-The program will continue to prompt the user to press enter and disappear more and more words until the whole text is gone.

What user inputs does it have?
It only checks if the user entered the "Enter" key, in other words, nothing, or the keyword "quit" to end the program. (=> As a Stretch challenge I could give the user the option to enter the scripture themselves).
 
What output does it produce?
It will output a string of text that will be changing as the program moves on, probably an instantiation of the full string that adapts as words disappear without affecting the original full string. 
How does the program end?
With the user typing the keyword "quit" on the console or running out of missing words.

Classes:

Main()=> We know what Main does :)

Menu() => Responsibility to display the options the user will have when starting the program and to loop until we've run out of words to disappear.

Scripture()=> Responsibility: to store the chosen scripture and its versions when words have disappeared. 

Word() => Responsibility: to store the randomly chosen word that will be hidden.

Reference()=> Responsibility: to store the reference of the chosen scripture to display it.

Trivia() =>Responsibility to ask for the reference (exactly as it should be written meaning this format "book chapter:verses-verses) for extra learning.

*Stretch challenge*
I'll include a list of scriptures that will be randomly chosen. I could include a little trivia game that would prompt the user to guess the reference before starting dissapearing the words.
